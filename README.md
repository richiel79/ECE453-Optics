# ECE453-Optics
An accumulation of code developed for the different computational components of weekly problem sets for Optical and Quantum Devices.   

The ObliqueIncidence_TM file contains the computational components for Problem Set (PS) 4 for solving and analyzing the conservation of energy, relationship of reflectance and transmission near the critical angle, and other physical quantities for stuyding the Oblique Incidence of TM Wave at a Dielectric Interface. 

The elec3D_well file answers computational components for simulating and analyzing the Quantum Dynamics of an Electron in a 3D Rectangular Potential Well PS.

The non_RWA file solves for the Non-RWA Terms in Rabi Oscillation PS.

The last file solves for the Transient Inversion Dynamics in Driven Two-Level Bloch Systems PS.
